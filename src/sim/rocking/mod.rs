//! Body-rocking simulation.
//!
//! Implements the spring-damper that drives `RockingState::angle_*` toward zero
//! each tick. Drive/Ship slope interpolation is owned separately by locomotor
//! runtime payload state.
//!
//! # Crash spin and Squid roll are live; ordinary impulses remain deferred
//!
//! `FootClass::Crash @ 0x004DEBB0` writes a crashing object's spin rates
//! (`sim::world::crash`), [`rocking_system::update`]'s crashing branch
//! ([`rocking_system::advance_crash_spin`], `RockingUpdate 0x0070B63D`)
//! integrates them, and the unit renderer draws the angles through Fly
//! Draw_Matrix's crashing arm (`render::vxl_raster`); Jumpjet crash tilt also
//! consumes these angles. Squid Parasite629A46 directly writes sideways roll
//! after this update, and Ship69F670 consumes it. Both producers install the
//! sparse state on first use. Everything below is about the ordinary damped
//! ground rocker, which still has no producer or Drive body-drawing consumer:
//!
//! - **No producer.** [`apply_rocker_impulse`] has no caller outside this
//!   module's tests. gamemd reaches `TechnoClass::ApplyRocker` (vtable `+0x3D8`
//!   → `0x0070B280`) from exactly four places, established this session by a
//!   `CALL [reg+0x3D8]` census over all 1.16M instructions in the image:
//!   `BulletClass::DetonateAtCoord @ 0x004699A1` (`DirectRocker=`, zero stock
//!   authors), `Apply_area_damage @ 0x00489DFF`/`0x00489E3E` (`Rocker=`), and
//!   `ParasiteClass::AI @ 0x0062A21C` (a parasite bite
//!   on a non-Infantry victim, force `1.5`; its lateral-sign RNG draw at
//!   `0x0062A17F` is taken in `combat/parasite.rs`).
//!   `FootClass::ReceiveEMP @ 0x004DECF0` writes the velocities directly
//!   instead. **Firing never rocks the body** — there is no
//!   `ApplyRocker` site in `Fire_At`, and none in any crush or deploy path.
//! - **No ground-body consumer.** The presentation consumers of
//!   `GameEntity::rocking` select Fly/Jumpjet crash arms, not ordinary Drive
//!   Draw_Matrix. A ground impulse alone would not tilt its vehicle body, and
//!   the self-destruct hook the production caller passes is
//!   [`NoopSelfDestruct`].
//!
//! - Trigger: a `Rocker=yes` warhead, such as stock `V3WH`, detonating near a
//!   vehicle. Ordinary stock `105mm`/`AP` shots do not enter either warhead
//!   rocker arm: the original Warhead constructor and `ReadINI 0x0075D3A0`
//!   retain both `Rocker` and `DirectRocker` as false for physical AP.
//!   Evidence: `tools/procedural_drawing_oracle/action_lines_attack_prerequisites.json`.
//! - Player effect: vehicles do not lurch when shells land beside them. The
//!   whole "shot lands next to the Rhino and the Rhino rocks" reading is
//!   missing.
//! - Frequency: engagements involving the applicable warheads or parasites.
//! - Downstream risk: wiring the producer alone would add per-entity
//!   deterministic state and move the pinned replay hash while changing nothing
//!   a player can see, so the producer and the renderer belong in one slice. See
//!   the verified DRIFT list on [`apply_rocker_impulse`] for what the impulse
//!   maths must also change when that slice lands.
//!
//! ## Dependency rules
//! - Part of sim/ — depends only on sim/components, sim/entity_store, map,
//!   rules, util/fixed_math. Never on render/, ui/, audio/, net/.
