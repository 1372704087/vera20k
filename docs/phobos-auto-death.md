# Phobos AutoDeath

A Techno type that destroys itself when a condition holds. The ported arms are
`AutoDeath.Behavior=kill|vanish|sell` with `OnAmmoDepletion`, `AfterDelay`,
`PlayerPowerState`, `PlayerMoney.Max/Min`, `TechnosDontExist` and
`TechnosExist`, and the `AutoDeath.VanishAnimation` list; the residuals below
list what is still open.

The two `AllowLimboed` keys fall back to `[CombatDamage]
AutoDeath.TechnosDontExist.AllowLimboed` / `AutoDeath.TechnosExist.AllowLimboed`
(`Ext/Rules/Body.cpp:631-632`), both `Valueable<bool>` defaulting to `no` and
read once from the merged layer state.

`AutoDeath.PlayerPowerState` takes `none`, `low`/`consumer` or `full`/`normal`
(`Utilities/TemplateDef.h:1762-1781`). The two money bounds are inclusive and
`-1` leaves that end open.

`AutoDeath.Behavior` is a `Nullable<AutoDeathBehavior>` (`Utilities/Enum.h:196`):
`kill` (0), `sell` (2) or `vanish` (1), matched with `_strcmpi`
(`Utilities/TemplateDef.h:1063-1083`). Absent, blank or unrecognised leaves the
`Nullable` unset, and `TechnoExt::CheckDeathConditions`
(`Ext/Techno/Body.Update.cpp:142`) returns at its first test — so
`AutoDeath.AfterDelay` alone arms nothing.

`AutoDeath.AfterDelay` is a `Valueable<int>` default `0`; a non-positive value
never starts the countdown (`:173`).

## Behavior

The check runs from `TechnoExt::OnEarlyUpdate` (`:26`), called at
`TechnoClass_AI @ 0x6F9E50+0x5` after `ApplyMindControlRangeLimit` and before
`ApplyInterceptor`. On the first visit it starts `AutoDeathTimer` with
`AfterDelay`; once the `CDTimerClass` completes it calls `KillSelf`.

Phobos tests `HasStarted()` before `Completed()`, which matters: an unstarted
`CDTimerClass` reads as already completed. VERA keeps that order by comparing
`start_frame()` with `PAUSED_START_FRAME`.

`KillSelf`'s non-limbo dispatch (`:769-824`) selects the arm from
`AutoDeath.Behavior`. The `Kill` arm (`:809-821`) deals the object's own Health
as damage with `[CombatDamage] C4Warhead=`, no attacker and no source house,
ignoring defenses: `ReceiveDamage(&pThis->Health, 0, C4Warhead, nullptr, true,
false, nullptr)`. VERA routes that through the shared direct-receiver owner, so
the object dies through the ordinary damage and death path.

The `Vanish` arm (`:771-790`) first plays a random
`AutoDeath.VanishAnimation` at `pThis->GetCoords()` with the object's house as
the animation owner (the list is `ValueableVector<AnimTypeClass*>`, so an
unresolvable name never entered it and the pick covers only loaded types), then
unloads a bunker the building holds (`BuildingClass::UnloadBunker`, the
`EmptyBunker @ 0x004595C0` owner), kills its passengers with the object as
their killer, stuns it, limboes it, registers the kill under its own owner
(`RegisterKill(pThis->Owner)`) and uninitialises it — no death animation,
corpse or C4 damage. The `Sell` arm (`:792-807`) sells a Building whose Buildup
SHP is bound (`+0x6E9`, `rules.has_buildup`) by queueing and commencing the
Selling mission unless it is already selling; anything else — a non-building or
a type without a Buildup SHP — falls through to the `Kill` arm, as the native
developer warning does.

The low-power arm is written
`(Full && !isLowPower) || (Low && isLowPower) && !isFirstFrame`. `&&` binds
tighter than `||`, so the first-frame guard applies to the `Low` arm only and a
`Full` type also dies on frame 0. That is reproduced as written.

The presence arms (`Ext/Techno/Body.Update.cpp:186-255`) scan the selected
houses for each listed type. Without `AllowLimboed` they read
`HouseClass::CountOwnedAndPresent` through VERA's on-map `+0x5550` family; with
it, the distinct limbo count is added. RESIDUAL: the wrapper's body was not read
instruction-level, and `docs/phobos-harvester-counter.md` records `+0x5500` as
the same query, so the counter identity is unproven. `Houses=` selects the house
set through `CanTargetHouse`, `owner` short-circuiting to the object's own
house. `TechnosDontExist` passes `!Any` into the scan, so its default `Any=no`
means "kill when none of the listed types exists" and `Any=yes` means "kill
unless all exist". `TechnosExist` uses `Any` directly.

The lists are `ValueableVector<TechnoTypeClass*>`: tokens arrive untrimmed, as
`strtok(",")` yields them, and a token that names no type is dropped when the
list is resolved (`Utilities/TemplateDef.h:1727-1742`). An all-unknown list
therefore leaves the arm's emptiness guard in charge instead of flipping the
decision — a typo keeps the object alive rather than killing it.

An owner change sets `ShouldBeDead` at
`TechnoClass_Captured_UpdateTracking @ 0x7015C9`
(`Ext/House/Hooks.cpp:231-259`), and the next `CheckDeathConditions` visit kills
on it (`Ext/Techno/Body.Update.cpp:159-163`). The master `OnOwnerChange=` arms
both directions unless each names its own; a change between a human and a
computer house takes the matching one. A transported object is spared only when
`AllowLimboed` is turned off — the `[CombatDamage]` global constructs `yes`
(`Ext/Rules/Body.h:1027`).

A type change through `TechnoClass::ChangeType` calls
`FootExt::UpdateTypeData` (`Ext/Foot/Body.cpp:219-221`), which stops a running
countdown when the new type has no `AfterDelay`. Without that reset a round trip
through an untimed type would return the unit with an already-completed clock
and kill it on its first timed visit. VERA reaches `ChangeType` from the Ares
`Convert.Water=`/`Convert.Land=` surface conversion, Ares `Convert.Deploy=`
(`sim/unit_simple_deploy.rs`) and the team-script conversion action
(`sim/team_script_vm/actions.rs`); all of them pass through the one owner, so
every conversion drops a stale countdown.

`GetValuesForDisplay` (`Ext/Techno/Body.Visuals.cpp:696-717`) reports the clock's
remaining time over its full duration for `DigitalDisplay` entries of type
`AutoDeath`; a type without `AutoDeath.Behavior=` draws nothing, and an unstarted
clock has a zero maximum, which the renderer skips.

## Residuals

- `FootExt::IsOwnerChangeFromRevertOnExit` is unported — the AttachEffect
  discard chain also reads it as `false` — so `IgnoreRevertOnExit` cannot fire
  and the owner-change transporter gate has no revert term.
- The vanish animation's `invoker=true` (`AnimExt::SetInvoker(pThis)`) has no
  VERA anim field; the animation keeps its owner house and object, so a later
  reader of the vanish anim's invoker sees none.
- `AutoDeath.AllowLimboed` is read for the owner-change transporter gate, but
  `KillSelf`'s limbo arm (`:721-766`) is unported, so a limboed object still
  never dies here and the object-level limbo gate refuses regardless of the key.
- Ares `SpawnSurvivors` before the fatal hit (`Ext/Techno/Body.Update.cpp:810-816`)
  is not ported. The hit ignores defenses, and VERA's death path then refuses its
  own survivor release and marks the transport handled, so an `AutoDeath`-killed
  `Crewed=`/driver Unit or Aircraft loses its crew where native ejects it.
  Reproducing Phobos' pre-call needs VERA's survivor owner taught the
  pre-damage context (it currently assumes the unit is already lifted), which is
  its own chain.
- The scenario-level `AutoDeathObjects` collection
  (`Ext/Scenario/Body.cpp:101-131`) tracks limboed objects for the limbo arm and
  is not ported with it.
- Native's early `return` from `OnEarlyUpdate` only skips the unported
  `ApplyInterceptor`; VERA continues the visit either way.
