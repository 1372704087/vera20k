//! Phobos `SpyEffect.*` building-type keys (`Ext/BuildingType/Body.cpp:337-345`;
//! fields `Body.h:59-61`; constructor defaults `Body.h:192-194`).
//!
//! `SpyEffect.Custom` is the Ares tag (`Valueable<bool>`, default `no`); the
//! two `ValueableIdx<SuperWeaponTypeClass>` keys are read only when the
//! `SuperWeaponTypeClass::Array` holds a type, and resolve a name through
//! `FindIndex` at read time. They are consumed by
//! `BuildingExt::HandleInfiltrate` (`Ext/Building/Body.cpp:316-356`), the
//! second half of Phobos's `BuildingClass_InfiltratedBy_Wrapper` hook at
//! `0x51A00B` (`:662-671`): after the base infiltration, each configured
//! index launches its house's copy of that Super at the building.
