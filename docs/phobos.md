# Optional Phobos compatibility

VERA20K can build in partial, Rust-native support for some Phobos extensions. It does not load the
Phobos DLL and is not general mod support.

Default builds use the retail readers and dispatch; an INI or client setting cannot enable omitted
extensions. Build the supported extensions explicitly:

```sh
cargo run --release --bin vera20k --features phobos
```

The capability is independent of Ares and NPatch: a Phobos build needs neither feature, and all
three combine with `--features ares,phobos,npatch`. Every implemented Phobos chain must keep working
when the other capabilities are compiled in — the compatibility rule and the pattern for two
extensions touching one native site are in
[NPatch placeholder](npatch.md#cross-extension-compatibility).

Phobos builds identify themselves in the window title, the startup log, and the build description
drawn at the tactical view's top right during a match. That description is Phobos's own text: the
product name, the version and the build-type warning derived exactly as `Phobos.version.h` derives
them, so a Phobos build prints

```
Phobos v0.5.0.0-alpha1. Please test the build before shipping.
```

in red on black, ten pixels in from the view's right edge — the same string, site and colors as
Phobos's `GScreenClass::DrawText` hook. Saves retain the build capability and cannot load in the
other mode, even with identical retail INIs.

## Original project and authors

VERA20K implements the behavior in Rust. It does not load `Phobos.dll`, import
Phobos C++ source or redistribute Phobos binaries; the native identities cited
by these pages are the Phobos sources named in each page.

Phobos is developed by the Phobos Developers. The features ported here
originate with:

- Custom radiation types - **Otamaa**, who ported and fixed the **Ares
  developers**' unfinished RadTypes code.
- Shields - **Uranusian**, **secsome**, **Belonit**; shield warhead
  modifications **Starkku**; absorption/passthrough **Morton**; respawn
  animation and weapon **Ollerus**.
- Custom ore spawners - **Kerbiter**.
- Custom gather animations - **secsome**, **Uranusian**.
- Ore-stage animation hiding (`HideIfNoOre` threshold) - **Otamaa**.
- Superweapon techno gates (`SW.AuxTechnos`, `SW.NegTechnos`,
  `SW.TechLevel`) - **NetsuNegi**; their building-upgrade counts -
  **NetsuNegi**, **Ollerus**.
- Digital display - **ststl**, **FlyStar**, **NaotoYuuki**, **Saigyouji**,
  **JunJacobYoung**, **CrimRecya**.
- Placement preview - **Otamaa**, **Belonit**.
- Sidebar GDI/NOD positions - **Belonit**.
- Infantry auto deploy - **TaranDahl**.
- Fly wobble switch (`FlyNoWobbles`) - **Noble_Fish**.
- Centred pause-menu background - **Starkku**.
- Unhardcoded timer blinking colour scheme - **Starkku**.
- Semantic locomotor aliases (`Locomotor=Drive` and the like) - **Belonit**.
- Missing cameo - **Uranusian**.
- Power plant enhancers - **secsome**, **NetsuNegi** (range), **Ollerus**
  (`MaxCount`), **Trsdy** (EMP).
- Power plant damage factor - **Otamaa**, **Ollerus**.
- Building production queue - **CrimRecya**.
- INI `$Include` / `$Inherits` - **Morton**.
- Skirmish AI dehardcoding (last-legs sale/hunt, MCV deploy regroup) -
  **TaranDahl**.
- Parallel AI queue forbids - **Trsdy**, **NetsuNegi** (by category),
  **Starkku** (by TechnoType).
- Unlimited skirmish colours - **Morton**.
- Superweapon sidebar - **NetsuNegi**, **CrimRecya**.
- Prone speed customization - **TaranDahl**.
- Type select for buildings - **TaranDahl** (code), **Ollerus** (doc).
- Flashing Technos on selecting - **Fryone**.
- Warhead self-damaging toggle (`AllowDamageOnSelf`) - **Starkku**; its and
  `DamageSelf`'s airborne fix - **NetsuNegi**.
- Custom gravity for projectiles - **secsome**.
- Warhead decloaking toggle (`DecloakDamagedTargets`) - **Starkku**.
- Airstrike flare visual customizations and fixes - **Starkku**.
- AttachEffect - **Starkku**, with target filtering **Flactine** and
  attach-event 606 **FS-21**.
- Critical hits - **Starkku** (logic), **AutoGavy** (warhead crit), and
  **Trsdy** (shield `ImmuneToCrit`).
