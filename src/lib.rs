//! RA2 Engine — library root.
//!
//! Re-exports all modules so integration tests and future binary targets
//! can access the engine's functionality. The binary entry point (main.rs)

// Asset parsers — .mix, .shp, .vxl, .pal, .tmp, .hva, .csf, .aud
// No dependencies on game modules. Standalone parser library.

// Headless asset browsing for automated callers — the `asset` binary.
// Sits above assets/ and rules/; never depends on sim/, ui/, audio/, or net/.

// GPU rendering — wgpu-based sprite, terrain, voxel rendering.
// Reads from sim/ state but never mutates it.
pub mod render;

// Game data from rules.ini and art.ini.
// Defines every unit type, building, weapon, warhead.
pub mod rules;

// Opaque process-RNG cursor receipt shared by map generation and simulation.
// Neither owner depends on the other's implementation through this DTO.

// Game simulation — EntityStore, fixed-point math, deterministic logic.
// NEVER depends on render/, ui/, audio/, net/.
pub mod sim;

// Menus, dialogs and the in-game sidebar: layout and state, drawn by app/ and render/.
pub mod ui;

// Sound/music via rodio.
pub mod audio;

// Map loading, terrain tiles, theater system.

// Multiplayer — deterministic lockstep command transport.
pub mod net;

// Shared utilities — config, fixed-point math, color helpers.

// The app orchestrator. Public for testing but not intended for direct use.

/// Headless retail-scenario loading for parity runs (no GPU, no window).
