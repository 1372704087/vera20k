//! The write half of UnitClass's live post-Foot Facing slot.
//!
//! `combat::world_fire::visit_fire` reads and writes this slot
//! immediately after the same Unit's Fire_At_Target (`7365E1`, `7365E8`),
//! before the second Ready/Commence checkpoint and the next Logic object.
//! The current target and selected weapon are read after FireAt's mutations;
//! a Bullet it created has not yet reached its later live Logic slot.
//!
//! Facing math stays in `sim/movement/turret`; this owner commits the hull,
//! turret and rotation-latch writes in native order. SpawnManager is a
//! separate TechnoClass AI_Update consumer, not a Unit post-Foot slot.

/// Commit one or more Unit Facing slots at their caller's object boundary.
/// `FacingClass::set` is a no-op when the destination already matches.
/// Signed ROT is refreshed from rules for each apply.
///
/// Four writes land here, and their ORDER is native, not incidental:
/// 1. the hull destination from `UnitClass::Fire_At_Target @ 0x00736DF0` case 2
///    (`FacingClass::Set(+0x388)` at `0x00737004`, then the hull's raw
///    destination copied into the turret slot at `0x0073701C` — `FUN_004C9470`
///    returns the DESTINATION dword, not the animated value). Native runs the
///    whole of `Fire_At_Target` before `Facing_Update`
///    (`0x007365E1`/`0x007365E8`), so this precedes everything below;
/// 2. `Facing_Update` arm A's aim `Set` on the turret, `0x00736A89`
///    (`None` = native calls no `Set`, so the turret holds its aim);
/// 3. the `+0x6AF` rotation latch — `MOV [ESI+0x6AF],AL` at `0x00736B16`, the
///    value being `FacingClass::Is_Rotating(+0x3A0) @ 0x004C9480` called at
///    `0x00736B11`, with the unconditional clear at `0x00736AD5` covering the
///    turretless and not-rotating cases. Read next tick by
///    `UnitClass::GetFireError @ 0x00741233`;
/// 4. `Facing_Update` arm B's idle-return `Set` on the turret, `0x00736BDD`.
///
/// Steps 3 and 4 are in that order in the binary, and it matters:
/// `FacingClass::Set @ 0x004C9220` writes `duration = abs(delta)/rate` and
/// `start = g_CurrentFrameCounter`, so any `Set` of one or more `ROT=` steps
/// makes `Is_Rotating` true immediately. An aim `Set` therefore arms the latch
/// on the frame it is issued — which is what keeps the fire gate refusing for
/// the whole arc, including its first one or two frames — while an idle-return
/// `Set` leaves the latch clear, so a unit that re-acquires a target during an
/// idle swing-back is free to aim at it on the next frame.
