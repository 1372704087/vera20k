//! Phobos `BuildingUndeploy.Leave=`'s relocation pick
//! (`Ext/WarheadType/Detonate.cpp:304-349`).
//!
//! When a warhead packs a building into its `UndeploysInto=` unit, `Leave`
//! sends that unit to a low-threat cell instead of letting it stand where the
//! building stood. The pick is three steps:
//!
//! 1. every armed, non-allied Techno within `CellSpread` 20 adds its type
//!    `Cost=` to the 16-way direction bin it sits in relative to the building
//!    (`pBuilding->GetTargetDirection(pItem).GetValue<4>()`);
//! 2. the ring is smoothed with a triangular kernel and the heaviest bin wins;
//! 3. the building's cell moves ~14 cells along that bin's radian and is
//!    snapped to a deployable cell.
//!
//! This module owns the pure half of that (steps 1's binning, 2 and 3's
//! offset). The scan and the snap live in `super::building_sell`.
//!
//! ## Dependency rules
//! - Part of sim/ — depends on rules/ and sim/ only; never audio/ or ui/.
