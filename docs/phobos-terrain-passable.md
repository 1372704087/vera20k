# Terrain passability

A terrain object (tree, rock, tiberium tree) normally blocks its cell.
Phobos lets an individual terrain type — or all ordinary terrain, or all
tiberium trees — be treated as passable.

```ini
[General]
Terrain.IsPassable=no      ; Valueable<bool>, default no (ordinary types)
Tibtree.IsPassable=no      ; Valueable<bool>, default no (SpawnsTiberium=yes types)

[TIBTRE01]                 ; [TerrainTypes] section
IsPassable=yes             ; Nullable<bool>, unset keeps the globals
```

Readers: `Ext/Rules/Body.cpp:479-480` (constructors `Ext/Rules/Body.h:894-895`,
both false) and `Ext/TerrainType/Body.h:33` (the per-type Nullable, read in
`Ext/TerrainType/Body.cpp`).

## Native body

`TerrainClass_SetOccupyBit_PassableTerrain` (`0x71C110`,
`Ext/TerrainType/Hooks.Passable.cpp:7-25`) returns before the occupation-bit
store when the resolved value is true, so the terrain contributes no cell
occupation. The `0x483DDF` arm sits inside `CellClass::RecalcZoneType`
(`0x483C80`): for a passable Terrain it sets `Passability = Passable` and
returns before the type-dword comparison that would classify the cell as zone
2 (Wall) or 5 (Building), so the cell keeps zone 0. `UnitClass::CanEnterCell`
(`0x73FB71`) skips the terrain checks, and `0x7002E9` selects a Move order
instead of an attack order unless force-firing.

## VERA

`PhobosGlobals::terrain_is_passable` / `tibtree_is_passable` read the
`[General]` pair, and `TerrainObjectType::is_passable` holds the per-type
Nullable. The RuleSet constructor projects the resolved value
(`project_phobos`, type key else the global selected by
`SpawnsTiberium=`). `TerrainObjectType::raw_occupation_bits` returns 0 for a
passable type, and the live/map cell projection stores **no**
`terrain_object_occupation` at all (rather than `Some(0)`, which would map to
zone 5): the object keeps its cell-list membership but contributes neither an
occupation mask nor a zone class, matching `0x483DDF`. The map-only terrain
types installed after the RuleSet constructor are projected too.

## Tests

- `src/sim/terrain_object.rs` — the type key, both globals, `SpawnsTiberium`
  selection, an explicit `no` beating the globals, the constructed state's
  zero bits and the projected cell no longer blocking.

## Residuals

- The `WhatAction` arm (`0x7002E9`) selects a Move order/action and is not
  ported; clicking passable terrain keeps the stock attack order unless
  force-firing. This is a player-visible input gap.
- The buildable-upon half of the same Phobos family is
  [its own page](phobos-terrain-can-be-built-on.md).
