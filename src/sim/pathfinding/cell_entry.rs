//! Cell entry: the terrain arm, the wall arm and shared Can_Enter_Cell leaves.
//!
//! The original RA2 engine returns 8 distinct codes when a unit
//! tries to enter a cell. Each code triggers a different movement response.
//! The classes' own `Can_Enter_Cell` ports are `Simulation::foot_can_enter`
//! and `aircraft_can_enter` (`world/object_entry.rs`). This module keeps the
//! terrain-only `evaluate_can_enter_cell`, the search's wall arm and the
//! building-entry and crush leaves those ports call.
//!
//! Bridge legality is now driven by A*'s `path_layers` (set per-step by `astar_search`
//! with the Ground→Bridge gates verified against the reference predicate), which
//! approximates the post-switch output of the original two-pass `Can_Enter_Cell`. See
//! docs/plans/2026-05-11-bridge-locomotor-layer-correctness-design.md §"Known Parity Boundary".
//!
//! ## The native shape, and what is not modelled
//!
//! `UnitClass::Can_Enter_Cell` @ `0x0073F0A0` and `InfantryClass::Can_Enter_Cell`
//! @ `0x0051BF90` are the `FootClass` `+0x1AC` slot (`0x007F5E1C` and
//! `0x007EB204`). Both are **accumulators**: a running code later occupants may
//! only raise, punctuated by hard `return 7` / `return 0` exits. `AStar_main_loop`
//! @ `0x00429A90` expands a neighbour iff the code is below 7 and
//! `AStar_compute_edge_cost` @ `0x00429830` indexes it into the float table at
//! `0x0081870C` — `[1.0, 1000.0, 1.0, 1.0, 60.0, 20.0, 8.0, 10000.0]`, whose only
//! reader is `0x00429848`. So codes 3, 4, 5 and 6 all still expand, at 1×, 60×,
//! 20× and 8× the base step.
//!
//! Pre-flight, in order, before any code accumulates: the bridge-deck select from
//! `Cell->Flags & 0x100`; the occupier/occupation snapshot; **Unit only** the
//! `MovementRestrictedTo=` gate; the direction-8 tube endpoint test; the
//! tube-direction consistency tests at this cell and at `(dir-4)&7`; **Infantry
//! only** an unconditional admit when `level - Cell->Level > 4`; the `+0x1B0`
//! slot (`CheckBridgeTraversal` @ `0x004D9C60`, FootClass-level — it is the same
//! entry in both vtables); the deck swap; the playfield gate; and **Unit only**
//! `FootClass::LocomotorPassabilityCheck` @ `0x004D9C10`, whose result **seeds**
//! the running code (Infantry seeds a literal 0).
//!
//! What VERA does not reproduce, recorded rather than guessed and ordered by
//! ordinary-skirmish impact:
//!
//! - **Gate identity corrected (2026-09-22).** `BuildingType+16B7` is `Gate=`:
//!   ReadINI4609EA..460A13 reads literal81AA8C. `4525F0` is gate passability,
//!   requiring Open mission24 and stable-open animation state. Unit73F6E8
//!   skips an open gate; a closed allied gate raises3, armed enemy raises5,
//!   unarmed enemy returns7. The old garrison interpretation was false.
//!   `+16C0` is the separate FirestormWall flag. Complete Unit-call evidence:
//!   `tools/spatial_oracle/unit_entry`. This establishes classification, not
//!   the downstream gate-opening/scatter response for every caller.
//! - **The wall arm produces the wrong code, not no code.** `cell_rect`'s
//!   `is_wall_overlay` / `WallBlocked` path is live and MovementZone-keyed, and
//!   its Destroyer-class escape set matches native's `{2, 3, 8, 0xC}` at
//!   `0x004835BB`. But it answers a **hard block** where native answers **4** for
//!   a friendly wall and **5** for an enemy one (Unit: `OverlayTypeClass+0x2A8`
//!   at `0x0073F420` with the `Crushable=` gate `+0x22D` at `0x0073F42E`;
//!   Infantry: `5 - isAlly`), and 4 and 5 both still expand in the A*. Retail
//!   therefore routes *through* a wall line at 60×/20× cost and stops at it.
//!   Trigger: any expansion into a `Wall=yes` overlay cell. Player
//!   effect: a move order whose destination is enclosed by walls is refused
//!   outright instead of routing to the wall and stopping. Frequency: pre-placed
//!   civilian fences appear on most stock maps, so this fires many times a match
//!   even against players who never build walls. Downstream risk: codes 4 and 5
//!   feed the blocked-step Override arm, whose wall case targets a *cell* rather
//!   than an object and has no Restore path; a producer must land together with
//!   that arm. **Do not add a second wall gate
//!   on top of the existing one.**
//! - **Crushable walls admit crushers and CrusherAll; every other mover is
//!   hard-blocked where native answers 4/5 or 7.** `OverlayTypeClass+0x22D` =
//!   `Crushable=` is parsed (`OverlayTypeFlags::crushable`) and
//!   `overlay_reduced_zone_type` reduces such an overlay to zone class
//!   `CRUSHABLE` (1), as `CellClass::RecalcZoneType` @ `0x00483CB5` does. The
//!   class arm below keys on that class: a `Crusher=` type (`+0xD28`; 29 stock
//!   types, the battle tanks among them) or a `MovementZone=CrusherAll` type
//!   (`[BFRT]`) enters, matching the crusher route of `UnitClass::
//!   Can_Enter_Cell` (`0x0073F42E..F46C`), and `UnitClass::PerCellProcess`
//!   then flattens the wall on arrival (I4, `apply_wall_crush_on_driveover`).
//!   Infantry (`0x0051BF90` has no crusher route) and non-crusher vehicles are
//!   refused, where native's weapon/warhead route answers 4 (allied) or 5
//!   (enemy) for a primary warhead with `Wall=yes` (or `Wood=yes` on a wooden
//!   overlay, Unit only) and 7 otherwise; an allied crushable wall answers 4
//!   even to a crusher; ability 0x11 also takes the crusher route. Those three
//!   are the wall-arm port (the previous entry). The four stock `Crushable=
//!   yes` overlays (`[GASAND]`, `[CAFNCB]`, `[CAFNCP]`, `[CAFNCW]`) are all
//!   `Wall=yes`; a modded crushable non-wall overlay would take this arm where
//!   native applies none. Trigger: a unit with a wall-capable warhead ordered
//!   across a sandbag or fence line, or a crusher crossing its own side's.
//!   Player effect: VERA routes such a unit around the line or refuses where
//!   retail routes through at wall cost and has it shoot; a crusher on an
//!   allied line pays nothing where retail pays 60x. Stock scope of that
//!   gap: the land non-crushers whose primary warhead carries `Wall=yes` are
//!   the IFV (`[FV]`, `HoverMissile` → `HE`) and the Brute (`[BRUTE]`,
//!   `Punch` → `Battering`); every infantry rifle (`M60` → `SA`) and the
//!   other non-crusher vehicles answer 7 natively, which this arm matches.
//!   Frequency: pre-placed fences and sandbags are map dressing on several
//!   stock maps.
//! - **`MovementRestrictedTo=`** (`UnitTypeClass+0xDFC`, Unit only): when set,
//!   the cell's land type must equal it. LandType 10 (Tunnel) is exempt from the
//!   equality test but carries its own rule — `g_IsometricTileTypeClass_Array`
//!   entries with `(+0x2E4, +0x2E8)` of `(5,3)` or `(4,3)` are impassable unless
//!   `bIsoSubTileIndex == 2`, and `(3,4)` or `(3,5)` unless it is `6`. The
//!   overlay window `0xED..=0xEE` escapes the return-7 only when the mover's
//!   level does **not** match the cell's (`0x0073F1FD JNZ`). Trigger: stock
//!   `rulesmd.ini` sets the key on `[HYD]`, `[SQD]`, `[ASW]` and `[HORNET]`,
//!   always `=Water`. Player effect: none observed — the two naval types are
//!   already covered by the water-mover path and the two carrier aircraft use
//!   `AircraftClass`'s own predicate. Frequency: effectively zero for this
//!   owner. Downstream risk: none.
//! - **The tube gates** (`0x0073F211` to the `RET 0x14` at `0x0073F2C6`):
//!   direction 8 — the sentinel
//!   edge `AStar_main_loop` emits as its ninth neighbour — requires a tube at the
//!   cell and then **returns 0 immediately**, skipping the whole rest of the
//!   predicate; Unit tests `tube+0x28 == 0` while **Infantry tests
//!   `tube+0x28 == tube+0x24`**. Separately, any direction whose delta from the
//!   tube's own direction falls in `3..=5` is impassable, tested both at this
//!   cell and at the back-step cell `(dir-4)&7`. Trigger: pathing into or along a
//!   tube cell. Player effect: VERA admits tube-adjacent steps native refuses,
//!   and misses the direction-8 fast admit. Frequency: tube maps only.
//!   Downstream risk: none; it is a leaf predicate.
//! - **The AI-only overlay arm** (`0x0073F3EC`-`0x0073F41D`):
//!   `OverlayTypeClass+0x2AA != 0` and the mover's house not human-controlled
//!   and `g_GameMode == 0` → 7. Infantry has the same arm without the game-mode
//!   term. Trigger: an AI mover in campaign. Player effect: none in skirmish.
//!   Frequency: zero until an AI opponent exists. Downstream risk: none.
//! - **The end-of-list land-row test.** Native checks
//!   `LandTypeSpeedBuildabilityRows[Cell->LandType][speed] == 0.0` **after** the
//!   object walk and only on the ground list; VERA applies it in the terrain
//!   head. Trigger: a bridge-deck step over a zero-row ground cell — water under
//!   a bridge. Player effect: native can still return an object code there;
//!   VERA answers impassable from the head. Frequency: every bridge crossing
//!   over water. Downstream risk: the deck plane suppresses the test in native,
//!   which VERA's `is_elevated_bridge_cell` arm already approximates in
//!   `TerrainCostGrid`, so the observable outcome usually agrees.
//!
