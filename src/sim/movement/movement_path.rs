///
/// **Hover was added 2026-08-27 (matrix row T1-01).** The exclusion was the
/// whole of that defect: a Hover mover never reached the layered builder, so
/// `build_flat_fallback_layers` stamped `Ground` on every node of its path
/// including the deck ones, and the crossing loop's terrain test then read the
/// deck cell's raw ground-walkability — the riverbed under the span — and
/// refused. The order was never dropped, so a Robot Tank ordered across a high
/// bridge accelerated into the abutment and was snapped back to cell centre
/// about thirteen times a second, indefinitely. The bridge legality check
/// itself passed every time; it was never consulted about the right plane.
/// Measured on BayOPigs.mmx: seven refusals, every one `layer_walkable`, zero
/// `bridge_traversal`.
///
/// Stock YR gives the Hover CLSID to `[LCRF]`, `[ROBO]`, `[SAPC]` and `[YHVR]`
/// — the Robot Tank and all three amphibious transports. (`ROBO` also carries
/// `TooBigToFitUnderBridge=true`, but that flag gates nothing in movement:
/// it is draw-pipeline-only (see `ObjectType::too_big_to_fit_under_bridge`)
/// and `Can_Enter_Cell` never reads it. It is not why a Robot Tank
/// could not use a span, and it did not stop one driving under one either.)
///
/// **What the one native gate on this path actually does.** VERIFIED 2026-08-27
/// by direct reads, with one stated premise rather than a read:
///   - *Premise (not a Ghidra read):* the movers this predicate admits are all
///     `[VehicleTypes]` — `ROBO`, `LCRF`, `SAPC`, `YHVR` alongside `MTNK`,
///     checked in `ini/rulesmd.ini` — hence `UnitClass` instances. That is what
///     makes the vtable read below the same slot the `CALL [EDX + 0x2CC]`
///     dispatches through for them: the read is at a fixed vtable, the call is
///     through the mover's own. Named because reading an offset is not the same
///     as proving a slot, and conflating the two has produced a wrong label in
///     this project before.
///   - `UnitClass`'s vtable is `0x007F5C70` — installed by
///     `UnitClass::Constructor` @ `0x0073543A`, and by its destructor and
///     `Load`. Identity rests on that existing Ghidra label; **UNCHECKED**
///     against RTTI/COL, which is the reliable route here.
///   - `0x007F5C70 + 0x2CC` = `0x007F5F3C`, which holds `0x004D3810`. Slot read
///     directly; not inferred from a callee offset, which is the trap that has
///     produced a wrong label in this project before.
///   - `FootClass::Find_Path` calls that slot at `0x004D397F`
///     (`CALL dword ptr [EDX + 0x2CC]`), and on a false return takes the
///     clear-and-return-0 exit at `0x004D3989`.
///   - `0x004D3810` (`CanReachDestination`) reads the type class through
///     `vtable+0x84`, takes `TechnoTypeClass+0x5B4` (**MovementZone**), returns
///     1 at once when that is `-1`, and otherwise tail-calls
///     `MapClass::Can_Reach_Zone` with it.
///
/// So the gate is a zone **reachability abort** — should the search run at all —
/// keyed on MovementZone, with no locomotor term. **Scoped claim:** at this
/// gate, nothing selects a pathing plane by locomotor kind. Whether anything
/// elsewhere in the binary does is UNCHECKED, and this comment does not assert
/// a binary-wide negative.
///
/// That is enough, because the change here **deletes** a VERA gate rather than
/// adding one: removing a restriction needs the absence of a verified native
/// gate demanding it, not an affirmative native proof. The fix's positive
/// evidence is production — two ordinary undisabled crossings on two retail
/// maps with different span axes.
///
/// Do NOT reason "same vtable slot, therefore same answer": a shared virtual
/// that reads type data answers differently per type, and this one does exactly
/// that. `ROBO` is `MovementZone=AmphibiousDestroyer` and `MTNK` is `Normal`, so
/// `0x004D3810` genuinely can separate them — it just separates them by zone,
/// not by locomotor, and never by pathing plane. An earlier draft of this
/// comment argued from `[VehicleTypes]` membership to a shared slot value to a
/// shared answer; the middle step is true and the last does not follow.
///
/// `Can_Enter_Cell` @ `0x0073F0A0`, `CheckBridgeTraversal` @ `0x004D9C60` and
/// the `ILocomotion+0x1C` slot are **UNCHECKED here** — reported as corroboration
/// that the downstream legality path is locomotor-agnostic, not re-read at this
/// callsite, and not the gate. Do not cite them as if they resolved `+0x2CC`.
///
/// The remaining `Drive | Walk | Hover` list stays VERA-internal. The other
/// five kinds — Ship, Fly, Teleport, Jumpjet and Rocket — are excluded because
/// admitting them is a separate question with its own blast radius, not because
/// the gate above excludes them; it excludes nothing by kind.
