//! A defeated house's end: `HouseClass::Update`'s multiplayer defeat gate,
//! `HouseClass::Blowup_All` and `MPlayer_Defeated`.
//!
//! Native owner: `HouseClass`. In every non-campaign game, once per house per
//! frame in HouseClass::Array order (`0x004F8E86..0x004F8F82`): a house that
//! is not defeated, not `MultiplayPassive=` and past frame zero, and whose
//! counts (`house_tracking`) say it holds nothing, has every object it
//! originally owns blown up (`Blowup_All @ 0x004FC6D0`) and is then marked
//! defeated (`MPlayer_Defeated @ 0x004FC0B0`, its only caller). With the retail
//! `ShortGame=yes`, losing the last counted building while no `BaseUnit=` is
//! tracked destroys the whole remaining army in that one call.
//!
//! Blowup_All walks TechnoClass::Array, limbo objects included, re-reading the
//! count each step. An object whose original owner
//! (`TechnoClass::GetOriginalOwner @ 0x0070F820`) is the house and that the
//! house still owns dies; one another house mind-controls is instead handed to
//! the Civilian-side house when its controller's CaptureManager finds one
//! (`SetOriginalOwnerToCivilian @ 0x00472330`), and dies only when none
//! exists. An object being erased first has its Temporal chain released
//! (`0x0071AD40`). Each dies through its own ReceiveDamage with its Health as
//! `C4Warhead=` damage, no attacker, ignoring defenses and passenger escape
//! (vtable `+0x16C`, called at `0x004FC766`): no kill credit, no survivors.
//!
//! Scenario draws (read, not executed): none in the gate or the sweep's own
//! code; each death draws in its own receiver (death sounds, debris, death
//! anims), in array order. The Temporal release idles the released attackers
//! (ClearLinkedList); VERA queues those idles, so any draw they make comes at
//! the idle's turn.
//!
//! Evidence: `tools/spatial_oracle/house_blowup_all.py` runs the original
//! Blowup_All with GetOriginalOwner, CaptureManager GetOriginalOwner and
//! SetOriginalOwnerToCivilian (10 cases; the Civilian side lookup is
//! supplied); `house_defeat_gate.py` the gate (21 cases). Control flow and
//! ordering read from the disassembly.
//!
//! RESIDUALS:
//! - Between the gate and the strategy tick, every eighth frame, native
//!   springs event 8 ("any event") on each of the house's tags, last to
//!   first (`0x004F8F87..0x004F8FBC`: the list at House+0x3C, its count at
//!   +0x48, `0x006E53A0`); VERA's trigger runtime keeps no tags on houses.
//!   Trigger: a map trigger attached to a house, mostly in campaigns.
//!   Effect: that trigger's "any event" never springs. Later owner: the
//!   trigger subsystem.
//! - TechnoClass::Array order stands on stable-id order (construction order),
//!   which matches for every source VERA constructs in native order.
//! - Slave release: a Slave Miner killed with no attacker hands its slaves on
//!   the map to the Civilian-side house and UnInits those in limbo (the
//!   ReceiveDamage death arm's `0x006B0AE0` call at `0x00702065`,
//!   `sim::slave_manager`). A master constructed before its slaves (its own
//!   constructor builds them) is reached first, and the sweep then skips
//!   them, as they no longer belong to the defeated house; a refinery
//!   deployed from a Slave Miner comes after the slaves it took over, so the
//!   sweep kills those first as the defeated house's own, in the same
//!   TechnoClass::Array order.
//! - The IsToDie path (`Flag_To_Die @ 0x004FC980`: DESTRUCT, REMOVEPLAYER, a
//!   last human's EXIT) has no VERA producer; offline skirmish cannot reach
//!   it.
//! - The trigger-held original owner (`+0x2CC`/`+0x2E0`,
//!   HouseClass::TransferUnitsTo) is not ported.
//! - MPlayer_Defeated's local-player branch (`0x004FC1E7..0x004FC307`: the
//!   whole-map reveal `0x00577F30` and the defeat UI), its capture-the-flag
//!   cleanup (Flag_Remove `0x004FBE40` at `0x004FC112..0x004FC15E`, Scenario
//!   flag `0x10`), the Harvester-Truce UnInit loop (`0x004FC163`, Scenario flag
//!   `0x800`) and Computer_Paranoid (`0x00501640`) are not ported; the flags
//!   are off in stock skirmish. Of the local branch only the map-clear byte is
//!   kept (see `mplayer_defeated`). Trigger: the local player is defeated.
//!   Effect: the shroud stays in place for the loser.
